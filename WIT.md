# Whatever it takes :horse_racing:



 







 **negrito* *



##  Whip, whip

Run me like a racehorse

### Hold me like a ripcord

Break me down and build me up

I wanna be the slip, slip

Word upon your lip, lip

Letter that you rip, rip

Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes

'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

###  I do whatever it takes

'Cause I love how it feels

### When I break the:chains:

Whatever it takes

You take me to the top, I'm ready for

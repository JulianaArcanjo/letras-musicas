# Fist Fighting a Sandstorm :fire:



*I fought so hard for your heart*
*On the way down*
*And I thought that I could save you from destruction*

## But I was never in contro-o-ol
*Never in control*
*Fighting a lonely war*
*No, I was never in contro-o-o*
*Never in control*

## Fighting a lonely war

*Was fist-fighting a sandstorm*
*Now I ain't boxing anymore*
*I'm letting go and it's beautiful*
*Fist-fighting a sandstorm*

*Fist-fighting a sandstorm*
*Is a losing battle*
*Was fist-fighting a sandstorm*
*Fighting a sandstorm*
*Fighting a sandstorm*

*Was fist-fighting a sandstorm*
*Was fist-fighting a sandstorm*
*But I won't fight it anymore*
*I'm letting go and it's beautiful*
*Ohh ohh!*

*I was hurting, I couldn't let go*
*Couldn't leave you*
*And I told myself, though it was hell*
*That we'd push through*

*But I was never in contro-o-ol*
*Never in control*
*Fighting a lonely war*
*No, I was never in contro-o-ol*
*Never in control*
*Fighting a lonely war*

*Was fist-fighting a sandstorm*
*Now I ain't boxing anymore*
*I'm letting go and it's beautiful*
*Fist-fighting a sandstorm*

*Fist-fighting a sandstorm*
*Is a losing battle*
*Was fist-fighting a sandstorm*
*Fighting a sandstorm*
*Fighting a sandstorm*

*Was fist-fighting a sandstorm*
*Was fist-fighting a sandstorm*
*But I won't fight it anymore*
*I'm letting go and it's beautiful*

*But I was never in contro-o-ol*
*Never in control*
*Fighting a lonely war*
*No, I was never in contro-o-ol*
*Never in control*
*Fighting a lonely war*

*Was fist-fighting a sandstorm*
*Now I ain't boxing anymore*
*I'm letting go and it's beautiful*
*Fist-fighting a sandstorm*

*Fist-fighting a sandstorm*
*Is a losing battle*
*Was fist-fighting a sandstorm*
*Fighting a sandstorm*
*Fighting a sandstorm*

*Was fist-fighting a sandstorm*
*Was fist-fighting a sandstorm*
## *But I won't fight it anymore*
*I'm letting go and it's beautiful*
*Ohh ohh!*
